Version 0.4.0 
- all parameters are marked as persistent
- insert fixed entries into the TC headers in case the pcdf entries of type 'P'( = other packet parameter whose value is automatically set by
the SCOS-2000 command subsystem (e.g. packet length, source sequence counters)) were encountered. 
  Previously these entries were skipped causing a bug if the last entry in the TC header was of this type.
