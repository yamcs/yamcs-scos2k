Version 0.7.2 released 18-Jul-2025
- added a configuration allowing the command ACK and APID to be settable by the user
- PUS 17 container verifier uses the APID now
- deduced parameters use the raw value

Version 0.7.1 released 13-Mar-2024
- added an option packetsContainingWritableParameters under the TM that allows listing SIDs of packets that will be declared as Local such that they can be written via Yamcs API. Missions use these pseudo-packets to inject data from external systems

Version 0.7.0 released 20-Feb-2024
- added an option generatePusNamespace enabled by default that causes names such as TM(5,25)_xyz or TC(3,11)_xyz to be associated to TM containers and commands, where xyz is the short description. Moved the second description into the short description

Version 0.6.0 released 16-Feb-2024
- updated Yamcs versions to support arrays in command arguments

Version 0.5.0 
- fixed the PUS1 verifier
- implemented aggregates for command arguments using groups

Version 0.4.0 
- all parameters are marked as persistent
- insert fixed entries into the TC headers in case the pcdf entries of type 'P'( = other packet parameter whose value is automatically set by
the SCOS-2000 command subsystem (e.g. packet length, source sequence counters)) were encountered. 
  Previously these entries were skipped causing a bug if the last entry in the TC header was of this type.
